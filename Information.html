	<h1>Information</h1>
	<p>We’re all sick of the GPU market being in such shambles, but could things change this year? Well, there is something
		in the works for sure.</p>
	<p> Nvidia tends to release a new graphics card family every two years, so we can expect to see the RTX 4000 series in September
		if it follows that same cadence. It still feels early for the RTX 4000 series, considering the relatively recent 3070 Ti
		and 3080. We’ll have to wait and see if there really is enough supply of RTX 4000 cards to meet consumer demand. The company
		is spending $44 billion on upgrading the capacity this year.</p>
